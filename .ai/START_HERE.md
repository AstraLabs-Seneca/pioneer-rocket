If you are an AI assistant helping in this repo, read in this order:

1. `.ai/AGENT_BRAIN_CORE.md`
2. `.ai/MULTI_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`
3. `.ai/TASK_ROUTER.md`
4. `docs/STUDENT_WORKFLOW.md`
5. `README.md`
6. The specific subsystem README you are working in

Then do this:

1. Pick one GitHub issue.
2. Make one scoped change tied to that issue.
3. Open one PR with evidence and `Closes #<issue-number>`.

Never return a plan longer than 3 concrete actions.
