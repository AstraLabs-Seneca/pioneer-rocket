# Concept Brief: ASTRA Labs Logo

**Status:** Concept Phase
**Inspiration Reference:** `ASTRA_Identity_Board_v2_brand_hex.png`
**Color Palette:** Astra Red `#FF3333`, Black `#000000`, White `#FFFFFF`

## The Objective
We need a custom, owningable logo for "ASTRA Labs" that moves beyond generic clip art.
The design should feel:
*   **Technical:** It's an engineering team, not just a club.
*   **Aerodynamic:** Use shapes that imply speed/lift (wings, arcs, trajectories).
*   **Modern:** Clean lines, vector-friendly, works in monochrome.

## Design Direction (Based on Board v2)
The user has selected the `ASTRA_Identity_Board_v2_brand_hex.png` as the key inspiration.
*   **Style:** Look for the specific geometric or stylized elements in that board (e.g., the way the "A" is formed, or the integration of a rocket silhouette).
*   **Typography:** Bold, sans-serif, commanding.

## To-Do for Designer (@Joel)
1.  **Analyze** the `ASTRA_Identity_Board_v2` reference.
2.  **Extract** the core shape language (is it the "A" as a rocket? The orbital arc?).
3.  **Refine** it into a standalone logomark using the **#FF3333** red.
4.  **Deliver:** Vector version (SVG/AI) + Transparent PNGs.
