## 🛠️ Technical Leadership & Governance

### 1. GitHub Management (The "Bot" Strategy)
> *Using AI to automate project management for ASTRA.*
- [x] **ASTRA Pioneer Bot:** Conversational Discord bot with PDR knowledge. (Live in Agape Briefings)
- [ ] **GitHub Issues Sync:** Automate issue creation from the `Astra_Rocket_Mindmap.md`.
    - *Goal:* Anyone can update the text file, and the bot updates the GitHub project board.
- [ ] **PR Summarizer:** GitHub Action to auto-summarize PRs for non-technical stakeholders.

### 🤖 Consolidated Discord Strategy
> *Avoiding "bot bloat" — simple tools for maximum leverage.*
- **Core:** `ASTRA Pioneer Bot` (Knowledge, Specs, Standups)
- **Work:** `GitHub Bot` (Issues, PRs, Kanban) — *Replacing Trello/Jira*
- **Community:** `Carl-bot` (Reaction Roles, Moderation)

### 2. Avionics & Telemetry Coordination
> *Supporting Sai and the Flight Computer team.*
- [ ] **Telemetry Specs:** Define data format for LoRa downlink (CSV/JSON schema).
- [ ] **Dashboard MVP:** Build a simple Next.js dashboard to visualize live rocket data (Altitude, Speed, Battery).
- [ ] **Documentation:** Ensure `06_Development/OBC` folder has clear pinout diagrams.
