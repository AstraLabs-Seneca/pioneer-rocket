**Subject: Quick Question: Does your Co-op Employer Sponsor Student Teams?**

Hey everyone! To hit our $6,200 funding goal by April, the fastest path is through our own employers. Many companies have **Student Sponsorship** or **Donation Matching** programs that go unused.

**Please reply with:**
1. Where do you work? (Company Name)
2. Do they have a student sponsorship/donation matching program? (Yes/No/Unsure)

Even a "Bronze" sponsorship is $500. If 4 of us land one, we cover 30% of our gap. I'll handle the sponsorship package/email if you make the intro! 🚀

**Follow-up Checklist:**
- [ ] If **Yes**: Ask for the specific contactperson (HR/Manager).
- [ ] If **Unsure**: Provide a 1-sentence script for them to ask their boss.
    - *"Hey [Manager], does [Company] ever sponsor student engineering teams? I'm part of a rocket team at Seneca called ASTRA Labs."*
- [ ] Send them the `SPONSORSHIP_TIERS.md` document.
