# 18.4 Business and Marketing Plan

## 18.4.1 Executive Overview
ASTRA Labs is not just building a rocket; we are building a **reusable launch platform** for student innovation. The *Pioneer* mission serves as a technology demonstrator for our "CubeSat-first" design philosophy, reducing the barrier to entry for students to access near-space environments.

## 18.4.2 Budget Analysis
Based on the February 2026 Bill of Materials (BOM), the total project cost is **$8,724.44 CAD**.

| Sub-System | Cost | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Mechanical | $1,638.92 | Airframe, fins, motor casing constraints |
| Flight Computer | $1,042.42 | Featherweight GPS + EasyMini Altimeters |
| Payload | $1,223.10 | 50x Student Picosats (ESP32-S3 array) |
| Transport & Stay | $4,820.00 | Launch Canada (Timmins, ON) logistics |
| **TOTAL** | **$8,724.44** | |

### Gap Analysis
- **Secured:** $2,500.00 (Estimated Initial Funding)
- **Gap to Close:** ~$6,224.44
- **Critical Hardware Deadline:** March 31, 2026 ($3,904.44 needed for flight hardware)

## 18.4.3 Fundraising Strategy
We operate on a three-tier sponsorship model to close the funding gap:

1.  **Institutional Partners (Seneca/HELIX):** Covering logistics and core facilities.
2.  **Corporate Partners:** Targeted outreach to Canadian aerospace and software firms (e.g., MDA, Magellan, software consultancies).
    - *Value Prop:* Access to top engineering talent (recruitment pipeline).
3.  **Community Engagement:** "Adopt a Picosat" campaign.
    - *Concept:* Donors can name one of the 50 picosats in the payload array.

## 18.4.4 Marketing & Outreach Plan
Our marketing strategy focuses on **"Building in Public"** to generate excitement and transparency.

### Channels
- **LinkedIn:** Professional updates, milestone achievements, sponsor shout-outs.
- **Instagram/TikTok:** Behind-the-scenes build videos, rapid-fire updates.
- **GitHub:** Open-source documentation of our Ground Station and picosat code to engage the dev community.

### Key Events
- **CSA Seminars:** Networking with industry experts (Feb-Apr).
- **Moonshot Event (April 7):** Public booth to showcase *Pioneer* avionics and picosat prototypes to the wider Seneca community.

## 18.4.5 Risk Management (Business)
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Funding Delay | High | Phased purchasing; prioritize Flight Computer & Motor first. |
| Logistics Cost Spike | Medium | Book accommodations early (Northern College); carpool. |
